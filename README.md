# Stephen,s Portfolio

This is a portfolio of the works that i have created since the start of the class. It includes edits to the Horiseon website where we cleaned up the CSS and added semantic HTML to the code. The other project is the Prework Study Guide that we created before the first day of class. The study guide inlcudes examples and notes of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
