        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Stephen Cooper. I was born in  1995 in Dallas, Texas. I lived in a suburb of Dallas called Mesquite until I was 8 years old. I then moved to Austin, Texas where I have lived ever since. 
            I am an avid sports fan and love watching the Dallas Cowboys, Texas Rangers, Dallas Mavericks, Manchester United, and the Texas Longhorns. I also love travelling, hiking, fishing, and trying out new restaurants 
            and bars.</p> 
            
        <p>Ever since I was 17 years old I have been working in the hospitality industry. I have worked anywhere from easy going BBQ restuarants like the world renown Salt Lick BBQ, to upscale Italian cuisine. 
            My most recent employment was actually at a spa at the Omni Barton Creek where I supervised front desk activities. For a long time I felt out of place and was not happy with the type of work I was involved in. 
            I realized it was time for a change. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, but then it dawned on me. For most of my life I have been a big fan of playing games and being on my computer. I figured I might as well 
            make a career doing something I ACTUALLY enjoyed. A friend told me about coding bootcamps and I didn't hesitate to start looking deeper. I found the UT Austin Bootcamp and almost immediately enrolled. I am 
            looking forward to a career in coding and can't wait to get started!</p>
